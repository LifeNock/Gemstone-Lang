# Gemstone 

A custom language built from the ground up. Targeting Windows/LLVM.

### The Plan
* **Syntax:** Clean, low-level, C-style but simplified.
* **Backend:** LLVM (targeting `.exe` output).
* **Final Goal:** Self-hosting (writing the Gemstone compiler in Gemstone).

### Project Roadmap
- [x] Initial Repo Setup
- [ ] Lexer / Tokenizer (Current Stage)
- [ ] Parser / AST Generation
- [ ] LLVM IR Code Gen
- [ ] Standard Library (Win32 API bindings)

### Why?
Just a project to learn how compilers actually work.
