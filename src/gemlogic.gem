# --- Gemstone Logic Test ---

# 1. Set a variable
mem power = 50

# 2. Print current status
emit "Checking power level..."
emit power

# 3. Test logic (Should print nothing)
if power > 100 then emit "Power is dangerously high!"

# 4. Modify memory
mem power = power + 60
emit "Power increased to:"
emit power

# 5. Test logic again (Should print now)
if power > 100 then emit "System Overload!"

# 6. Check equality
if power == 110 then emit "Power is exactly 110"
